# mooshak

A series of solved problems, extracted from the programming olympics.

## Example

You can look an example in the `example` folder. The example is in spanish for now, sorry about that. You can compile and test the program with `make test`. In order to do that, you need `g++` and `make` installed in your system.

## Rules

Solutions written in C or C++, without using any non std library.
